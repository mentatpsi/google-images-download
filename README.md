# Google Images Download
Python Script for 'searching' and 'downloading' hundreds of Google images to the local hard disk!

## Summary
This is a command line python program to search keywords/key-phrases on Google Images and then also optionally download all images to your computer. This is a small program which is ready-to-run, but still under development. Many more features will be added to it going forward.

## Compatability
This program is compatible with both the versions of python (2.x and 3.x). It is a download-and-run program with no changes to the file. You will just have to specify parameters through the command line.

## How to run the script?
1. Download this repository on your local hard drive
2. Open the terminal (for mac/linux OS) or command prompt (for windows OS) and browse to the location of the file 'google-images-download.py' on your local disk.
3. Type in one of the following command mentioned below

## Usage
If you have python 2.x version installed

`python google-images-download.py --keywords "Polar bears, baloons, Beaches" --limit 20`

If you have python 3.x version installed

`python3 google-images-download.py --keywords "Polar bears, baloons, Beaches" --limit 20`

To use the short hand command

`python google-images-download.py -k "Polar bears, baloons, Beaches" -l 20`

To use color filters for the images

`python google-images-download.py -k "playground" -l 20 -c red`

===> **Keywords** denotes the words that you would want to search for, **limit** donotes number of images that you would want to download and **color** denotes the color filter that you would want to apply to the images. Only the keywords field is mandatory.

===> The images would be downloaded in their own directories in the same folder as the python file.

## SSL Errors
If you do see SSL errors on Mac for Python 3 please go to Finder —> Applications —> Python 3 —> Click on the ‘Install Certificates.command’ and run the file.
